This game requires the user to guess a letter on the keyboard. If the key they push matches the letter the computer guessed, the user wins. If not, that letter is displayed on the screen and the guesses left counter goes down by 1. If the guesses left counter gets down to 1 and the user guesses incorrectly, they lose.

Technologies Used:
  HTML
  CSS
  JavaScript
  
Improvements for Future Versions:
  In future versions, the user will not be able to guess the same letter twice. Also if they hit a key other than a letter on the   keyboard, an alert message will pop up.
